Cell::

States: Iphase (non-replicating), Mphase (replicating), Aphase (dead)
- Iphase: can feed, cannot replicate
- Mphase: cannot feed, can replicate
- Aphase: cannot feed, cannot replicate
More:
- Cell's default state is Iphase
- Cell's only enter Mphase when they have fed on 3 other cell
- Cell's enter Aphase if they haven't fed on 1 full cell in a time period

Actions (only cells touching on the grid): Compete, Ignore, Cooperate
- Compete: traits determine whether a cell feeds or is fed-on (plus 10% random chance)
- Ignore: cells ignore each other for a set time before checking to compete, ignore, or cooperate again
- Cooperate: if more than 2 cells are all touching each other, 2 <= x <= n-1 (n=total cells in mutual contact) cells can choose to cooperate and split the remaining cell/s

Actions (if no cells touching or if cell decides to ignore): +x, -x, +y, -y

Traits (inheritable): competitive, ignoretime, movefrequency, movespeed, phasechange
- Competitive: likelihood to cooperate + likelihood to (attempt) feed + likelihood to ignore = 1
- IgnoreTime: ticks the cell ignores after deciding to ignore
- MoveFrequency: how often the cell utilizes move actions
- MoveSpeed: how many tiles a cell moves per move action
	- NOTE: each move action will consume the same amound of energy (number of fed-on cells) regardless of trait value
- PhaseChange: likelihood of cell to enter Mphase after having sufficient energy

Mutations: each iteration (when formed) will have a 5% chance of +/- unit on any trait (traits mutate in a mutually exclusive manner)
